# SpeakIt – Public Speaking Training App

A web–app that helps users improve public-speaking skills through interactive practice sessions, feedback and progress tracking.

---

## 🎯 1. Project Overview

SpeakIt is designed for anyone looking to build confidence and competence in public speaking—students, professionals, or hobbyists.
Key goals:

* Provide a friendly, low-pressure environment for practise.
* Enable structured practice with features like timed speeches, topic prompts and recording.
* Leverage analytics or simple metrics to offer feedback (e.g., pace, filler-words, speech length).
* Track progress over time so users can see improvement.
* Make the tool accessible (web-based) and easy to use.

---

## 🧩 2. Core Features

* **Topic prompt generation**: Randomised or curated speaking topics to practise on demand.
* **Timed speaking sessions**: Set a time limit, start speaking, receive a countdown and stop spark.
* **Recording & playback**: Users can record their speech and play back to self-evaluate.
* **Simple analytics / feedback**: Potential metrics like total speech time, pause count, filler-word detection (future).
* **User progress tracking**: Keep log of past sessions, scores or basic statistics.
* **Responsive UI**: Built using modern web stack (TypeScript/JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Vite) for a smooth front-end experience.
* **Configuration environment**: .env / environment support for API keys, backend endpoints, etc. (See `.env.example`).

---

## 🛠️ 3. Tech Stack & Architecture

**Front-end**

* Built with TypeScript & JavaScript.
* Tailwind CSS for styling (via `tailwind.config.js`).
* Vite as build tool (`vite.config.ts`).
* ESLint for code quality (`eslint.config.js`).
  **Back-end**
* A `server/` directory overview suggests there is a backend component (Node.js / Express or similar).
* Environment variables configured via `.env.example`.
  **Build & dependencies**
* `package.json` lists project dependencies & scripts.
* `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.app.json` for TypeScript configuration.

## ✅ 4. Getting Started (Installation & Setup)

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak392/speakit-public-speaking-training-app.git  
   cd speakit-public-speaking-training-app  
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install  
   ```
3. **Configure environment**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   * Fill in any required keys (e.g., backend API URL, speech-recognition keys, etc.)
4. **Run the app in development mode**

   ```bash
   npm run dev  
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port configured) in your browser.
5. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build  
   npm run serve  
   ```

---

## 💡 5. Usage & Workflow

* Launch the application in your browser.
* Choose a speaking topic or use “Random Prompt”.
* Start the timer and begin your speech.
* Stop when the timer finishes or when you’re done.
* Record the speech (if enabled) and listen back.
* Review any feedback/metrics (e.g., time taken, any flags for excessive pauses).
* Save your session; revisit earlier sessions to track improvement over time.
* Use “Settings” (if available) to adjust time limits, prompt categories or enable more advanced feedback.

## 🧪 7. Testing & Quality

* ESLint is configured for code linting (`eslint.config.js`).
* Use `npm run lint` (if script exists) to check for issues.
* Future: Add unit/integration tests (e.g., Jest + React Testing Library for front-end, supertest for back-end).
* Consider adding CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to enforce lint/build before merges.

---

## 🔭 8. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

* **Advanced speech analytics**: Detect filler words (“um”, “ah”), measure speaking pace, pause frequency.
* **AI-powered feedback**: Use speech-to-text + NLP to summarise strengths/weaknesses of speech.
* **User authentication & profiles**: Save sessions per user, allow progress across devices.
* **Mobile app / PWA support**: Make the platform accessible on mobile.
* **Leaderboard or peer review**: Allow users to share and review each other’s speeches.
* **Customizable topics/categories**: Let users add their own prompts or select categories (business pitch, academic, wedding toast).
* **Multi-language support**: Extend beyond English to other languages.
